# RSA_Cipher  

## Demo implementation of RSA algorithm  
Project for Data Protection subject at CS studies 
Includes private and public key generation from random prime numbers of 2048 bits, encryption and decryption of messege up to 256 bytes  

## Compilation and run  
javac rsa/RSA_Cipher.java  
java rsa/RSA_Cipher <list of files>  
  
Every given file will be encrypted and decrypted, then save to new file
